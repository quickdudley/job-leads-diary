# Job Leads Diary

A tool for keeping track of my job applications. Not ready for any kind of use
unless you're very comfortable with ghci.

## Plans

 1. Make it have a mode of operation other than running the functions directly
   in ghci.

 2. Generate a weekly report which I can show to the Ministry of Social
   Development and thus continue qualifying for welfare until my job hunt is
   successful.
